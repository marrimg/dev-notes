Cookies and local storage serve different purposes. Cookies are mainly for reading server-side, whereas local storage can only be read by the client-side.
Apart from saving data, a big technical difference is the size of data you can store, and as I mentioned earlier localStorage gives you more to work with. In conclusion, the question when dealing with the two, one should ask is, in your application who needs this data- the client or the server?
