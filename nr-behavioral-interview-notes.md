# Passion

## What is something you learned recently?

How to build plugins for Ableton using JavaScript! Ablton is audio software, for making and recording music (digital audio workstation). It has a platform called Max for Live that lets you build plugins for things like audo effects and sequencing patterns of notes. It supports Node, and also has an api called the LOM, which was probably names after the DOM. It's interesting because there's also a visual programming component to it, kind of like Pure Data, where the concept is that you patch together objects in a way that creates a control flow. I built a small sequencer that generates chord patterns.

## Tell us about how youâ€™ve dealt with unexpected changes to deadlines or project scope.

Sometimes you can push back on unexpected work, and sometimes you have to move forward. If you're able to (for example, if you need to add new features to the existing work and you have a somewhat flexible deadline) you can finish the sprint's work the way it was originally defined, and then make a new ticket for the update, for next sprint. EXAMPLE: the original mockup for a story was for desktop view, but we got a mobile mockup mid-sprint.

Sometimes you can't get around changing the acceptance criterial mid-sprint. Either way, it's definitely something you should bring up in your sprint retro, and work on fixing. You might need to talk to the product owner to make sure all of the AC are being defined in the story before the beginning of the sprint.

## Talk about a time where you had to make a decision in a lot of ambiguity
When I first joined my team, we didn't have a designer, and there wasn't a lot of back and forth communication between the design team and the front end team. There were times I had to make design decisions myself about a particular feature. For the most part, I looked for existing documentation, and followed existing UI patterns that I found in the app for similar situations. Moving forward, I tried to reduce the ambiguity by reaching out to the design team, and ultimitely we got a designer assigned to our team.

## Tell me about a time when you were unable to meet a project deadline. How did you react?

I think a lot of the time, when a team misses a sprint goal, it's because of something in the planning process. The team might need to adjust their sizing, or break stories down into smaller pieces, or capture all of the acceptance criteria for a task.

Sizing: If a team uses story points, it can take time for a team to come to a consensus about what story points mean. The team might underestimate stories at first. 

Breaking down: A lot of the time, stories aren't broken down into small enough pieces. It can be hard to capture all the acceptance criteria in one ticket.

Struggling team: Sometimes teammates struggle with their work. Plan more time for mobbing/pairing and honest check-ins.

## Describe a time when you knew you did or said something that caused a problem for a coworker, a customer, or an employee. What problem did it cause? How did you know it caused a problem? What did you do? What did you learn?

We're organized into product teams at Simple, which include developers from different domains: front end, back end, mobile. PR reviews are handled by our domain teams, so if we need a PR review, it's handled by FE devs on other teams. There was a time a few months back when we were getting so wrapped up in our individual teams' work that we were starting to take a little too long to handle PR requests. Someone brought it up in one of our FE team meetings and I realized that I was doing it, too. I talked to my team about it in the context of another conversation we were having about better sprint planning. We decided to break stories down into more managable pieces so I wouldn't feel like I was rushing to get my sprint commitment done. That way, I had more time to look at PR requests as they came in.

# Bold

## Tell me about a time you took a risk.
At Simple, we've been working on building risk taking into our deployment strategy. We've been releasing a lot of experiments, which are small, feature flagged changes. Analytics about user behavior, live user feedback sessions, and monitoring data feed into whether we make the experiment live to all users.

## Tell me about a time you had an innovative idea that had a positive impact

There wasn't a lot of communication between the design team and the front end team. This was leading to problems, like the design team and the FE team going in different directions with plans for global UI components. I decided that we should foster better communication between the two teams.

There were several Slack channels that included members from both teams, but some of them were dead. One of the channels had some activity, but most of the people in it were designers. I encouraged more FEDs to join the channel so we could have an agreed-upon forum. I also set up a meeting to talk with the design team to compare the FE team's UI library with the Figma designs and find places where they didn't match.

For example, when I created a new grid component, I set up a Zoom call to chat with the designer. We aligned on the size of the gutters, and made sure that the UI grid matched the 12 column grid that the design team used.
