# FACING PROBLEMS

## Give me an example of a problem you faced on the job, and tell me how you solved it.

**situation**: Teammates were spinning their wheels/taking a long time to complete a task/lost
**action**: Implemented a weekly mob programming session/ team policy that each PR should have at least one comment/ should respond on Slack
**results**: Team members were better supported and their performance improved

## A failure that occurred in your job and how did you overcome it

**situation**: Too many bugs were making it to QA and being caught by the QA engineer, causing us to spend time communicating/fixing them
**action**: We worked hard to increase our test coverage/test coverage of AC/adopting better technology so we could catch the bugs early
**results**: Initially, we caught more bugs early in the process, causing our QA engineer/PO to be less stressed and saving the team time. Later, it enabled us to transition to more of a devops based model where we were able to take on more of the QA responsibilities ourselves, as engineers.

## Tell me about a situation in the past year in which you had to deal with a very upset customer or co-worker. / Describe a time when you were faced with problems or stresses at work that tested your coping skills. What did you do? / A crisis in your life or job and how you responded or recovered from it / A time in your career or job where you had to overcome stress

**situation**: Our client was going through a major reorganization to scaled agile (SAFE). A lot of the teams and project managers were stressed and/or lost.
**action**: We attended PI planning, joined their teams, and worked with them to plan our sprints. We served in a consultant role and would help them with AC if needed and talk through the various agile ceremonies (sprint planning, backlog grooming, retros) and how they had helped our team at Metal Toad.
**results**: Happier team managers, better defined work. We heard feedback from the client that they really appreciated our help.

## A time when you dealt with an annoying coworker

### Annoying trait - not listening — making decisions based on preconceived ideas without weighing pros and cons, or evidence

**situation**: Our team from Metal Toad was split up and embedded into two teams at the client’s office. Our new project manager wanted to completely change our established priorities and refused to listen when we said that we still needed to collaborate with the rest of our team and keep making progress on our refactoring goals
**action**: Our team scheduled a meeting with him to go over the history of our project, team and goals, and the importance of looking at the application as a whole system, not just the specific feature set our team was working on. In the process, we realized that he was very stressed and had a lot on his plate, and part of his reluctance to see our point of view was that he didn’t want to add to his workload. We offered to help him write tickets for the refactor work and take on the task of reaching out to the developers on the other team.
**results**: We were able to achieve our goals without adding to the manager’s workload. After he realized that we were trying to save time in the long run, he came around to our point of view.

## A time when you dealt with an annoying coworker

**situation**: A team member seemed very checked out and was taking a long time to complete his work.
**action**: We talked with him and realized that he was getting stuck on tasks and wasn’t reaching out to the team for help. We decided to implement “honest check ins” as part of our mid-sprint review meeting, and eventually added a weekly mob programming session that provided a forum for team members to get help on tasks that they were stuck on.
**results**: The team member was much more engaged and the entire team saw an improvement in our velocity.

# LEADERSHIP

## Give an example of a time when you had to be relatively quick in coming to a decision.

**situation**: XOXO LLC had to decide whether they would move forward with the existing codebase, or start from scratch
more time deciding if the existing code was workable or not.
**results**: We were able to move forward with defining the minimum set of requirements, hiring an agency, and giving them the requirements and schedule for them to plan their work.

## Give me an example of an important goal you had to set and tell me about your progress in reaching that goal.

**situation**: I was very siloed doing CSS at DAT
**action**: I decided to dive into learning JS/React. I took online courses (TylerMcGuiness.com), took on more JS tasks, and reached out to team mates for help
**results**: I integrated myself into the dev team and moved into more of an engineering role

## Give me an example of when you had to show good leadership.

**situation**: Good software should be easy to reason about, fail quickly, and be easy to test. The existing app was none of those things.
**action**: We pitched a major refactor
**results**: When we got time to refactor, we were able to deliver new features much more quickly, and increased our code test coverage from 0% to over 70%. We were much more confident in the stability of our code and found potential bugs much faster.

# PREVIOUS PROJECTS

## Describe the most creative work-related project you have completed.

Creating a UI/design system for DAT - what do links look like? buttons? how do errors appear?

## Favorite project that you’ve worked on?

DTNA refactor - very satisfying increasing test coverage, seeing bug reports decrease and developer satisfaction increase
XOXO project - enjoyed learning more about apollo/graphql/react hooks/css-in-js

# TEAMWORK

## A time where you functioned as part of a team and what your contribution was

Situation/**Action**: Code Reviews, mentoring, code reviews, sprint planning, team decision making, helpfulness, client communication, clarifying acceptance criteria
**Results**: Team members felt supported, no one was stuck spinning their wheels without help

## Give me an example of a problem the team faced

**situation**: Team mates were spinning their wheels/taking a long time to complete a task/lost
**action**: Implemented a weekly mob programming session/ team policy that each PR should have at least one comment/ should respond on Slack
**results**: Team members were better supported and their performance improved

# IF STUMPED…

Say, “That’s a good question. Let me think about that.” (painful silence that feels like an eternity while you silently panic)
Think aloud - Walk through your thinking about the problem (panicked rambling that may or may not be relevant)
Ask for more info - What is this related to? How does it relate to my experience? (Grasping at straws)
"I'm having a difficult time thinking of a specific answer to that."
